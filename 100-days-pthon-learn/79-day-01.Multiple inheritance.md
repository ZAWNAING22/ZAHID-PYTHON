# Multiple Inheritance in Python
Multiple inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This can be useful in situations where a class needs to inherit functionality from multiple sources.


## Syntax
In Python, multiple inheritance is implemented by specifying multiple parent classes in the class definition, separated by commas.
```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2, ParentClass3):
    # class body
```

In this example, the `ChildClass` inherits attributes and methods from all three parent classes: `ParentClass1`, `ParentClass2`, and `ParentClass3`.

It's important to note that, in case of multiple inheritance, Python follows a `method resolution order (MRO)` to resolve conflicts between methods or attributes from different parent classes. The MRO determines the order in which parent classes are searched for attributes and methods. 

## Example
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Sound made by the animal")
        
class Mammal:
    def __init__(self, name, fur_color):
        self.name = name
        self.fur_color = fur_color
        
class Dog(Animal, Mammal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed, fur_color):
        Animal.__init__(self, name, species="Dog")
        Mammal.__init__(self, name, fur_color)
        self.breed = breed
        
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark!")
# Example:
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")
        super().show()

class B:
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A, B):
    pass

c = C()
c.show()
       
```
In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from both the `Animal` and `Mammal` classes, so it can use attributes and methods from both parent classes.

Ah! Now this makes sense — you’re seeing A’s super() calling B’s method and it looks weird at first, but it’s how Python’s MRO works in multiple inheritance. Let’s break it down carefully.



Output:

A
B

Why A’s super() calls B

C inherits from A and B: class C(A, B)

Python calculates the MRO (Method Resolution Order) for C:

print(C.__mro__)


Output:

(<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>)


When you call c.show():

Python looks in C → not found

Looks in A → found show(), executes it → prints "A"

Inside A.show(), you called super().show().

super() does not automatically go to the parent class (object) — it goes to the next class in C’s MRO after A, which is B.

So B.show() is executed → prints "B"
